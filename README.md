# BrokJSON
Ever struggled with huge GeoJSON-Files? BrokJSON is your space-saving alternative! Depending on your data you can save up to 80%. **Withouth losing any data!** Why? Because it is based on the same ideas as GeoJSON but reduces redundancies.

The idea behind BrokJSON: **RAM is mightier than the bandwidth** - download the small BrokJSON and convert it on runtime to GeoJSON than loading a huge GeoJSON.
